1. Overview

In a distributed version control system, each user has a sperated (cloned) copy
of the repository. They perform ordinary version commands (commit, checkout,
etc.) on their own copies. Every user could work independently, and they can
communicate with each other. Popular distributed version control systems include
git and mercurial. [HW: Citation needed.]

2. Conflict with Access Control

Distributed model is not fundementally in conflict with access control, but it
makes it difficult. The reason is that a user can not simply "clone" a
repository while a user wants to share a repository. If a user simply clones a
repository, the user will be able to read every file in the repository,
including those files the user does not have "read" permissions.

In order to enforce access control mechanism in distributed model, we need to
carefully design a protocol to avoid the issue. Basically we need a way to
"partial clone" only the files that the user can access, and methods to "add" or
"remove" information when the access control list changes. We need a lot of
lower level modifications to git (about storage system and other things) to git.
So this will be future work and we will not include it now.
