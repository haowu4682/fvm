The data model for FVM could applied to Slingshot with some modifications.

1. Overview

The motivation for Slingshot is to rebase machine states. Assume starting from
state A the machine goes to state B and C like the following:

A ----> B
  |
  ----> C

What we want is to perform all the actions in A->C at state B, making it like:

A ----> B ----> C'

If we consider the machine states to be file system states, the abstraction is
similar to FVM. We can say that A, B and C are 3 commitments. The user enters
backtrace mode at A. C is the mainstream and B is a branch. The user wants to
exit backtrace mode at this point, and the merge policy is to perform all the
"actions" in A->C at commitment B.



2. Solution

Record the action list at each commitment. Replay the action while the user
performs a "merge". The method for recording and replaying is in the Slingshot
documentation.
