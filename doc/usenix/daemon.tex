\section{Details of \Sys Daemon}
\label{s:daemon}

\hw{Some overview stuff}

\subsection{Protocol}

\hw{Introduce the protocol between server(daemon) and client}

\subsection{Partial checkout}

\include{fig-pcode-checkout}

Figure \ref{f:pcode-checkout} depicts the pseudo code for partial checkout.
Basically the process has two steps: the first step is to search for a user
specified relative path, and the second step is to retrieve files starting from
that point. \hw{The reason to divide the process into two steps is to save the
cost to traverse the files the user is not intereseted in.}

\subsection{Partial commit}

\hw{This subsection is similar to the previous one since the mechanisms are
similar, we will write it later.}
