1. Motivation

Here are the questions we wish to answer in eval section:

(1) What is the performance of \sys, compared to regular revision control
systems?

(2) How can \sys solve the problems that regular revision control systems could
not solve?

(3) Any other questions interested TBD.




2. Performance experiments

We compare the following aspects for \sys and regular revision control systems
(SVN, GIT, Mercurial, etc.):
Time cost,
Disc space cost,
CPU/Memory cost,
Network cost

We perform the following actions for a repository created by making a single
commitment of a fixed set of files to an empty repository:
make a commitment of a file,
checkout a file
enter branch mode (for regular systems, create a branch)

To sum up, the experiment set is:
{\sys, git, svn, mercurial, ...} * {commit, checkout, branch}

In each experiment, we collect {time-cost, space-cost, cpu/memory-cost,
    network-cost}
