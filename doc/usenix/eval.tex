\section{Evaluation}

To evaluate the performance of \sys over alternative VCSs, we measure the
several aspects with both \sys and alternative VCSs. The alternative VCSs
include \hw{TODO: Name alternatives.}

We evaluate the speed of several common operations for version control. Those
operations are called micro benchmarks. Figure \hw{TODO: write a table}
describes the equivalent operations for each micro benchmark in each VCS.

In all following experiments, we consider that there is only one server and one
client located in the same data center. The server machine holds an NFS server,
and the client machine can visit files through NFS protocol. The network latency
between the server and the client is relatively low, which is about
\textred{XXX} seconds. \hw{TODO: CPU, memory, OS information for both machines.}

\subsection{Time cost}

We first evaluate the end-to-end time cost for each micro benchmark in each VCS.
Figure \textred{XXX} depicts the results. \hw{More words.}

\subsection{Space cost}
