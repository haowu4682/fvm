%Talk about importance of access control in version control.
Access control is an important feature when multiple users are sharing some
common files. However, most popular version control systems nowadays do not
support full access control. Although some retro version control systems based
on file version have some kind of access control based on files, the feature is
quite limited in recent systems like \git and \mercurial, which only allow the
user to set permissions on the whole repository instead of invidual files and
directories.

%Talk about \sys.
We propose \sys, a version control system based on \git with access control on
both time and space. \Sys could restrict the user from viewing a subset of the
commit history, as well as a subset of files in each commit.

Besides access control, \sys has another objective: combine different branches
into the same working directory. This is a useful feature when a user is working on
different branches simultaneously.
