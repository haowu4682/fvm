\section{Design of \sys}
\label{s:design}

\input{fig-arch-abstract}

Figure \ref{f:arch-abstract} \hw{TODO graph} shows the architecture of \sys.
\hw{Describe each part in \sys.}
%\hw{One small paragraph to remind the user that we use \git data model basics.}

\subsection{Data Model}

%\hw{copied from design\_v2.txt}
As said before, \sys separates the \emph{repository} and the \emph{working
directory} (\emph{workdir}). A repository is a database which stores files
and directories of a file system. The repository is stored on the server
machine. A workdir is a directory in a file system which is used to
contain a subset of files from a repository, and allows the user to view and
modify. (A user cannot view and modify files from a repository directly.) The
workdir belongs to the client machine.

\hw{Consider briefly introducing commit, tree and blob here.}

\hw{TODO Include a figure showing the relation between repository and workdir:
notes/gv/partial.dot.pdf.}

% Partial checkout/commit stuff
Figure \ref{f:partial-data-model} shows the relation between the workdir and the
corresponding commit in the repository. \hw{TODO: explain the figure.}

\subsection{Server Client Model}
\hw{Consider combine this with the previous subsection.}

It is much easier to solve the access control problem for version control in a
server client model than in a fully distributed model.\HP{Talk about this in
the discussion session or an appendix. See notes/distributed-model.txt for some
discussions.} \hw{Summarize brief reasons here.}

Basically, a server serves as the role of an administrator. The server side
program of \sys (a.k.a \Sys Daemon) has the permission to access any files in a
repository stored on the server. The client side program, on the other hand, can
only access the files that the user has permissions to access. \HP{Remind the
readers to see the next subsection for more details.} The access control is
guaranteed by \sys, which will be described in the next subsection.

When the user wants to access a subset of files via \sys client, the client
sends a request to the \Sys Daemon, and the \Sys Daemon will perform a related
action. If the client needs to "checkout" a subset of files, \Sys Daemon will
perform a partial checkout action; if the client needs to "commit" a subset of
files, \Sys Daemon will perform a partial commit action. The details of the
actions \Sys Daemon could perform is in Section \ref{s:daemon}.


\subsection{Access Control Model}

The motivation scenarios suggest that \sys should have an access control method
throughout both the time and the space. \hw{Check with section 2.}
Therefore, \sys uses a two dimensional \HP{Any good word here?} way to record
access control information. One dimension is the access permissions in each
file, the other dimension is an access control list in each commit.

The access info\HP{Is this phrase good?} in each file is \unix-like.
Figure 3-a \hw{TODO draw the graph} shows a sample of the access permission
information of several files in a directory. Figure 3-b\hw{TODO draw the graph}
shows how the access
permission information is stored in the backend git database.

The access info is the typical mechanism for access control in systems
without version control. However, as motivation case \textred{XXX} suggests\HP{
shall we put an example here?}, access control should be not only
throughout\HP{good word?} the space, but also throughout the time. Since the
commit history represents the time span in a version control system, \sys
records an access control list in each commit, which controls access permissions
throughout the time.

\input{fig-access-list}

Figure \ref{f:access-list} shows the content of an access control
list sample. The access control list contains the "group status" at the commit
point. The group status contains the list of users that belong to the group.

In each checkout or commit action, \Sys Daemon calls the access control part to
checkout whether a file is allowed to be accessed by the user. Figure
\textred{XXX} shows the pseudo code of it.\HP{Do we need pseudo code here?}
For each file, \sys retrieves the access info of the file, and the access
control list info from the commit. It checks the permission in the following
ways:

(1) If the user is the owner of the file, check if the file's "user read" or
"user write" bit is set.

(2) If the user is not the owner of the file, and it belongs to the group of the
file in the access control list, check if the file's "group read" or "group
write" bit is set.

(3) If the previous two conditions are not met, check if the file's "global
read" or "global write" bit is set.

The process then returns whether the user has the permission to access the file,
correspondingly.

\hw{TODO Describe how it solves motivation case \#1}

\subsection{Branch Mode Model}

\hw{Describe the branch mode basics.}
\hw{Describe how files in branch mode are mapped in the repository.}
\hw{Describe how to enter/exit branch mode.}


\subsection{Trace Level and Automatic Commit}
\hw{Mention trace level and automatic commit stuff if we have space. This
subsection should be relatively short. This is unimportant.}
