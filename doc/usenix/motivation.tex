\label{s:motivation}
\hw{Is this a good title?}

A user may use an VCS for multiple purposes: software configuration management,
backup service, sharing service, etc.\HP{Any more possible usage? Is the grammar
correct?} Among these purposes, the most important and well-known usage is
software configuration management. This section will start from the review of
\textred{XXX} real life scenarios, continue with discussions of how traditional
VCSs\HP{Correct grammar?} reacts with those scenarios, and then end up with a
list of properties an ideal solution is desired to have.

\subsection{Scenarios}

\hw{Describe Case \#1, 2, 4 in design\_v2.txt}

\subsection{Issues with tradiditional VCS}

\hw{Explain why traditional VCS could not solve those scenarios}

\subsection{Properties}

\hw{Summarize the principles \sys is desired to have in order to solve those
scenarios.}
