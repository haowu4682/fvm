1. Overview

The goal of gitfs is to build a system with two properties: (1) The system
is able to perform version control; (2) The system allows different users to
share data.

There are already many network file systems which could do (2). There are also
many version control systems which help to do (1). What we need to do is not to
reinvent those two techniques. Instead, we can build a file version management
(FVM) tool which uses both techniques to achieve the goals.

A FVM assumes an underlying shared file system (SFS) which allows multiple users
to share their files in the same namespace, and a version control system (VCS)
which allows a user to track the modifications and roll back at any time. It
does not depend on which actual file system and version control system the user
is using given those conditions satisfied.



2. Design

2.1 Shared File System
The shared file system (SFS) provides one single important property: everyone
who wants to share files has the same namespace. It could have a global
namespace like [Mazieres99], or only a local namespace like in NFS, given that
everyone wants to share files use the same NFS server.

We assume that the SFS is a network file system. The server stores data and the
client visits data. The server is accessible to all the data while the client
has access restrictions. If the SFS is a local file system, we can just set the
server and the client to be the same machine and the mechnisms still works.


2.2 Version Control System

A version control system has the ability to make snapshots and rollback at later
time. We define the following concepts to avoid ambiguition later.

TRACED FILES Trace files are the files that need to be version controlled.

WORK DIR The work dir is the directory which contains all the traced files.

COMMITMENT A commitment is a snapshot of traced files.

CHECKOUT To checkout a commitment means to change the state of the work dir to
        the snapshot of a commitment

UPSTREAM The upstream is the current state of work dir.

HEAD The HEAD is the most recent snapshot of traced files. The difference
        between HEAD and UPSTREAM is that UPSTREAM contains the files without snapshot.

BRANCH A branch is a list of commitments. The HEAD within a branch is called a
        BRANCH HEAD.

REPOSITORY A repository is a set of everything above.



2.3 Single User Mode

The single user mode is quite straight forward. The FVM just automatically make
commits at time. When the user wants to rollback/make a branch, the FVM simply
calls the corresponding command of the underlying VCS.

Experiment result shows that it is very costly (in both space and time) to
make a commit for every file change in the file system. There are two factors
which affect the performance: (1) THe frequency of commitment; (2) The number of
files in the commitment. We will discuss the two factors below.

The automatical tracing might mess up with some of the VCS command and we will
also discuss about them below.



2.3.1 Frequency

A working machine has thousands of "write" operation and hundreds of "close"
operation during tasks like text editing. \hw{estimated value according to
Slingshot experiment.} However, we don't need to make commitments that often in
real life. We only need to make commitments much less frequently(e.g once per 10
minutes). A user is often torable to a loss of 10 minutes, and it is much easier
to find the correct commit to checkout if there is only one per 10 minutes
rather than 100 per second.

2.3.2 Tracing Level

There would be no need to keep track of most temporary files, for example, web
cache. Tracing level is used to specify which files and directories will be
included in the repository automatically. Here are the choices of tracing levels:

Full: Trace everything.
Update: Only trace files and directories already existed in the repository.
None: Trace nothing.

The tracing level is only used for automatical tracing. The user could always
manually add anything to the repository no matter what the tracing level is.

Here is an example config for tracing levels. ##level(path)## defines the
tracing level of all files and subdirectories in the specifed path.

###############################
# Start Tracing Level Settings
level("/") = Update
level("/home/") = Full
level("/home/.firefox/.cache") = None
......
# End Tracing Level Settings
###############################

2.3.3 Full Backtrace Mode

Usually when a user is using the system, the changes made by the user are
commited automatically (unless the user choose the trace level "None"). When the
user checkouts a previous commitment, the work directory will contain the old
versions of files instead of the most recent ones, and the automatical
commitment will contain the old versions of files. Although sometimes this is a
reasonable action, there are other cases when the user does not want this to
happen. For example, the user might checkout a previous version in order to
read the content, but do not want add the file into current upstream. As a
result, we introduce (full) backtrace mode for the user to choose an action to
the previous commitment, without modification to the upstream.

The user could use full backtrace mode to checkout all the files from a
previous commitment. In the full backtrace mode, the automatical commitment is
turned off so that the previous commitment will not be messed up with the
current upstream. Correspoding the regular mode is called the upstream mode.
After the backtrace mode the user could choose one of the four operations:

[MW: I don't really understand any of the text in the paragraph above.]
[HW: A new paragraph added.]

(1) ABADON the changes in the backtrace mode, return to the current HEAD.

(2) REWRITE the current HEAD with changes in the backtrace mode.

(3) MERGE the current HEAD with changes in the backtrace mode.

(4) MAKE A BRANCH with changes in the backtrace mode.

No matter which one is chosen, the current state returns to upstream mode and the
automatical commitment is turned on again.

2.3.4 Partial Backtrace Mode

The partial backtrace mode is used to checkout only several files in a previous
commitment instead of the whole repository. In partial backtrace mode, only the
files checked-out have their automatical commiment feature turned off.
Everything else is the same with the regular backtrace mode.

Since full backtrace mode is just a special case of partial backtrace mode
where every file in the repository is checked-out. We can use partial backtrace
mode solely and do not provide full backtrace mode. "Backtrace Mode" always
means the partial backtrace mode thereafter.

One implementation problem is that most VCS does not support the behavior of
only checking out several files, and we might need to do some hacking to the VCS
for that.



2.4 Multi-User Mode (Sharing Mode)

Given that the users do not share files (i.e. at most one user is accessible to
each file), every user just needs to run the single-user mode FVM respectively.
So problems only exist when the users need to share files.

Since a user often does not have permissions to access the repository files of
another user, the client side could not solve the sharing problem independently.
As a result, we run a FVM daemon on the server side to help solve the sharing
issue. In the following context, "FVM" refers to the client side, and "FVM
daemon" refers to the server side.

2.4.1 Package

In sharing mode, a user should be able to access multiple repositories. We use
"package" as an abstraction for "multiple repositories". A package is a set of
package items. A package item is a triple <repo, link_src, link_dst>, which are
defined below:

repo: The root of the repository the user wants to access.

link_src: The relative path of the files the user wants to access from the root
        of the repository.

link_dst: The path that the user wants to store the files to be accessed (a.k.a
        work directory)

[MW: is what's happening below similar to a mount, as in Unix file
systems?]
[HW: I think it is more similar to "git clone"]


For example, </home/bob/bob.git, falcon/, /home/alice/bob-falcon> means that
Alice wants to put the files in "falcon/" of the "/home/bob/bob.git" repository
into her own package, at the place "/home/alice/bob-falcon". The effect is
similar of running "ln /home/bob/falcon /home/alice/bob-falcon", but maintains
the versioning information.

A package item could also specify a user's own repository. For example,
  </home/alice/alice.git, /, /home/alice> means that the repository
  "/home/alice/alice.git" is put under "/home/alice", which is what the
  single-user mode does.

2.4.2 Package Organization

Basically, every package item grows independently. FVM only records which
package items are in a package, and use the VCS to remember those information.
These information is used when the user wants to rollback in the backtrace mode
(See 2.4.4). The information recorded looks like:

++ Start ++
</home/alice/alice.git, /, /home/alice>
</home/bob/bob.git, falcon/, /home/alice/bob-falcon>
++ End  ++

There is an alternative design in 2.4.4 which records more information.

2.4.3 FVM Daemon

Since the user may not permission to access every file in another user's
repository, he/she could not be allowed to access some VCS internal objects,
which causes it impossible to checkout/make a commitment on the client side.

The following example shows that why the user could not checkout a commitment.

+++ Example of Permission Problem +++

Backgroud: Alice wants to share Bob's repository. The package item is
    </home/bob/bob.git, falcon/, /home/alice/bob-falcon>. Alice wants to
    checkout the commitment 1abcdef from the repository. The VCS is git. She has
    no permission to view any files other than falcon/ in Bob's repository.

How to checkout: Alice grabs the root tree object from the commitment object,
    which looks like:
file_name    type    object_name
falcon       tree    4a5b6c7d
zookeeper    tree    abcdef77
My Photo     tree    12345677
foo.txt      blob    76543210
    She then grabs the object "falcon", and any sub-objects to achieve the files
    in the commitment.

Permission Problem: When alice grabs the root tree object, she knows not only
the "falcon" object, but also other object like "foo.txt" which she has no
permission to view.

+++ Example of Permission Problem Ends +++

[MW: what's below is interesting. is one way of saying it that FVM
proxies commits?]
[HW: I think so.]

So we introduce the FVM daemon which resides on the server. It has the
premission to every file on the server. It accepts the user's request, and only
provide the information that user has permission to access to the user. Here are
two basic functions:

(1) When the user wants to checkout a commitment for a package item, the
FVM daemon accepts the request and checks out the files using "link_src" and
"repo" from the package item, and put them under the "link_dst".

(2) When the user wants to make commitment for a package item, the
FVM daemon accepts the request and make a commitment using the file changes the
user provided.

Note that if the user has full permission of a repository, the user could
directly make commitments/checkout commitments to the repository without going
through the FVM daemon. This saves some overhead talking to the FVM daemon.

2.4.4 Package Backtrace Mode

The user could rollback the package link status (the status of which package
items exist in the package) using pakcage backtrace mode. FVM checks out
the specified package organization information recorded in 2.4.2. For each
package item in those information, FVM checks out the content of "link_src" in
"repo" and store the content in "link_dst".
[MW: please clarify the last sentence.]
After that the user could use
(repository's) backtrace mode to rollback any files in a certain repository.

An alternative design is that FVM also records the HEAD of each package item.
The information looks like:

++ Start ++
</home/alice/alice.git, /, /home/alice> HEAD=1abcdef
</home/bob/bob.git, falcon/, /home/alice/bob-falcon> HEAD=1234567
++ End  ++

When the user rollback the package, the user also rolls back the version for
each package item. (Like in the partial backtrace mode, the user could only roll
back a selected set of files instead of whole repositories.) The rest is similar
to the backtrace mode of a single repository.

3. Challenges

3.1 "When to remember"

How often should FVM make a commitment? A trade-off exists here. Frequent
commitment leaves more information for rollback in the future, but also
increases resouces (CPU cycles, disk space, etc.) cost.

There are several different policies for that. For example:

(1) Make a commitment on every write()

(2) Make a commitment on every close()

(3) Make a commitment based on a fixed time interval

Which one is the best policy?

[MW: Could you apply an idea from Rethink the Sync (Nightingale et al.)?
Essentially, store a commit only if the contents of that commit could be
externally observed? (Maybe this doesn't make sense.)]
[HW: Every commit "COULD" be externally observed (but the user could choose not
to observe it), so it does not make sense. Rethink the Sync mainly talks about
something different.]


3.2 "What to remember"

Apparently not all files in the file system needs to be traced. We use the trace
level to specify different tracing policy, which is similar to what [Santry99]
does.



3.3 "How to organize files (to allow sharing)"

Tradinitional versioning file systems (Copy-on-Write file systems) usually
focus on the versioning of every single file. They do not consider the
ralationship between different files. A VCS could trace a repository and retains
every version of a repository, but does not allow the sharing between
repositories. FVM proposes a loosely linked way called "package" to allow some
kind of relationship between repositories. Is this the best to allow sharing?



3.4 "How to forget"

Assuming that the storage space does not increase, the whole storage will
eventually be full when the system has no way to remove old versions. However,
since the storage space every user could use increases during technical
improvement of hardware techniques, it is not clear if the claim is still a
problem. So there are 2 questions here:

(1) Is it necessary (or worth doing) to forget some old versions to save some
space?

(2) If (1) is true, how can we do that?

[Santry99] might be a good reference for the question.



3.5 "What to rollback"
[MW: this challenge sounds interesting]

The existance of versioning file systems shows that the user often wants to
rollback one or several files instead of the whole file system, unless there is
a huge problem like OS corruption which makes the user have to rollback the
whole file system. For example, a user finds out a huge problem in the Falcon
project and wants to rollback to the state one day ago, he does not want the
family photos he updated during the day to disappear during the rollback.

FVM creates a mechanism called "partial backtrace mode" to solve the problem. Is
it the best way to do?


3.6 "Which version to rollback"

[MW: this challenge sounds interesting]

A user must decide which commitment to rollback before checking out a previous
commitment. In most VCS system, the commitment message, manually typed in by the
committers, helps the user to decide. However, if the commitments are generated
by FVM automatically, how could the user find out that. Would "diff" help? How
about the commitment time? Is there a heuristic way to generate some commitment
message?

This question is related to 3.4. Perhaps a good timing to forget a version is
that the user has no way to distinguish between adjacent versions.

[MW: sentence above is interesting]

3.7 "Permissions during sharing"

When a user wants to share another user's file(s), he/she should not be able to
access any files or get any information that he/she does not have the permission
to access. [MW: what does previous sentence mean?]
As a result, the user should not be able to touch the VCS internal
storage, which contains information of files that the user has no permission to
access. However, several problem arises:

(1) How could the user decide which version to rollback?

(2) How could the user make commitments?

(3) How could the user checkout previous version in backtrace mode?

We use a FVM daemon running on the server to extract only the information that
the user has the permission to access. However, this may have scalability
problems. Is there any way to solely depend on the client side to solve the
problem? This may require hacking to the VCS.

2.4

Although the users could share files, we need to ensure that each file belongs
to at most one repository. Otherwise if someone wants to checkout previous
commitment, the upstream of another user will be affected. We will explain
solutions below.
\hw{Usually the reason of such a conflict is a misconfiguration of tracing
levels. If users does not manually trace any files, and any two users do not
both have trace level "FULL" or "UPDATE" for any file, there should be no
conflict.}

The SFS already has the ability to allow users to share the upstream files. So
FVM only needs to allow the users to share the files in the previous commitment.
The user could do this in virtual backtrace mode. We will explain them below.

2.4.1 Conflict Check

On each commitment, the FVM sends a change list to the FVM daemon. The FVM
daemon checks if any file in the change list is also contained in another
repository. If so, the FVM daemon rejects the change and warns the user about
it.

2.4.2 Virtual Backtrace Mode

When a user (the observer) wants to checkout the previous commitment of another
user (the owner), the observer could use "virtual checkout" and enter "virtual
backtrace mode". The virtual backtrace mode is different from regular backtrace
mode in two ways:

(1) In regular backtrace mode, the upstream is concealed and the whole work dir
returns to the commitment state. In virtual backtrace mode, the upstream is not
affected, and the commitment snapshot goes to a user-specified location (usually
an empty directory in the user's repository) called the virtual path.

(2) In regular backtrace mode, the automatical tracing is suspended. In virtual
backtrace mode, the automatical tracing is still running, except for the
directory which contains the commitment snapshot.

A typical command for a virtual checkout looks like:

fvm virtual-checkout <repository> <commitment_id> <real_path> <virtual_path>

FVM forwards the requent to the FVM daemon. The FVM daemon then calls the VCS
with the repository, commitment and the real path to get the shared files in the
commitment snapshot, and put them in the virtual path. \hw{The FVM daemon does
not need to check permissions because the underlying SFS and VCS already
maintains correct permissions for the checked-out files.}

FVM then turns of tracing for the virtual path and the observer could do
anything on that in the virtual backtrace mode. After the virtual backtrace mode
the observer could choose:

(1) ABANDON all the changes in the virtual path, return it to upstream. This is
        often used when the observer only wants to take a glance of the files.

(2) ADD the virtual path into the observer's own repository. In this way, the
        relation of the virtual path and the real repository is cut off. This is
        used when the observer wants some file from the owner but does not want
        update information for that. For example, the observer wants to grab a
        copy of a photograph the owner once downloaded and deleted.

(3) OVERWRITE the upstream of the owner's repository. This is very dangerous
    (the owner's repository will change silently) and is not recommended.

(4) make a COMMITMENT to the owner repository. The request is sent to the FVM
daemon. The FVM daemon then uses the change list and previous checkout
information to create a commitment and put it into the owner's repository. This
is often used when the observer and the owner are co-workers on the checked-out
files.

No matter which one the observer chooses, the virtual backtrace mode is off and
the tracing is back to normal.
